# Customize location of Docker binary (especially for development testing).

# Start docker deamon listening on local socket and local port,
# so we can use ssh port forwarding and DOCKER_HOST to remote
# manage docker
DOCKER_OPTS="-H tcp://127.0.0.1:2376 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock"

# If you need Docker to use an HTTP proxy, it can also be specified here.
#export http_proxy="http://127.0.0.1:3128/"

# This is also a handy place to tweak where Docker's temporary files go.
